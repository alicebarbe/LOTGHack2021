# LOTGHack2021

The aim of this app is to provide a very easy-to-use educational tool for coaches and parents. A checklist for common symptoms of concussions and a link to the nearest hospitals encourages parents/coaches to go through all the criteria calmly and take any possible injury seriously. Further links signpost coaches/parents to more sources of information online.
